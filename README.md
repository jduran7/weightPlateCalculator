# Weight Plate Calculator

This app's purpose is to let a user find the best combination of plates
when assembling a dumbbell / barbell to reach a specific weight. The user can decide if
this is for a single dumbbell / barbell, or two dumbbells of the same weight.

## Inputs

- A weight rack: this is a collection of weight plates represented as an object. The keys should be the
  weight, and the values are the amount of plates available for each weight.
- A target weight: The total amount of weight the user wants to assemble.
- Pair: Choose if the weight should be for one or two dumbbells (as a boolean with
  true meaning a pair of dumbbells and false meaning a single dumbbell). The target weight should be
  the weight for each individual dumbbell.

These are some sample inputs:

```
const weightRack = {
  1.25: 5,
  2.5: 6,
  5: 4,
  10: 4,
  20: 4,
  45: 2,
};

const targetWeight = 50

const pair = true

```

## Outputs

The output generated by the app provides the combination of weights as an object.

For example, with the sample inputs above, the answer generated is { '5': 4, '20': 4 }.
That means the users should be using 4 5lb plates, and 4 20lbs plates. In this case, as it is
a pair, it would be 2x 20lbs and 2x 5lbs plate on each dumbbell.

## Using the app

1. Modify the user inputs in ./userInputs.js
2. Run this command in the terminal: `node generateCombinations.js`
